Misery
======

*This library is dedicated to all python developers
who wrote a lot of unmaintainable code trying to work with
databases asynchronously.*

In spite of its name, it may be a good choice because:

- it is asynchronous from the beginning
- it can save you from writing significant amount of boilerplate code
- it can help you to separate business logic from data storage details 
- it works well with MyPy
- it doesn't use a lot of magic
