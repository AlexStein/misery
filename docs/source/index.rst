Misery
======

*This library is dedicated to those Python developers
who wrote a lot of unmaintainable code trying to work with
databases asynchronously.*

In spite of its name, it may be a good choice for you because:

- it's asynchronous from the beginning
- it can save you from writing significant amount of boilerplate code
- it can help you separate business logic from data storage details
- it works well with MyPy
- it doesn't use a lot of magic
